# Resume-Screening-NLP-Project

The Resume Screening Project is designed to enhance and automate the recruitment process by categorizing resumes into predefined job categories using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. This repository contains comprehensive documentation and code for the project.

Project Highlights:

Data exploration using NumPy, pandas, and Plotly to understand and visualize job category distributions.
Text data processing including data cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization, and label encoding.
Implementation of traditional machine learning models (Multinomial Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors) and a deep learning model (RNN) for resume categorization.
Evaluation of model performance based on accuracy and classification reports.
Emphasis on data cleaning, preprocessing, and data visualization.
The Resume Screening Project serves as a foundation for implementing automated resume screening systems that significantly streamline and improve the efficiency of the hiring process by accurately categorizing resumes into relevant job categories.
